In order to test the SkySQL Monitor in a standalone environment
there are a number of steps that you will need to do.

1. Install a suitable Java Runtime Environment if you do not already
have one

2. Install the Apache web server, this is required to run the API
to the sqlite database.

3. Install the sqlite database schema from the SkySQL admin_schema
respository. Execute admin_schema to get a "standard" MySQL setup.
If you wish to monitor a Galera cluster then run the admin_schema.Galera
script after the admin_schema script.

4. Configure the Apache rewrite rules to allow access to the RESTful API

5. Setup api.ini with an API key for the monitor, e.g.

	# cat /etc/scdsapi/api.ini 
	; This is the INI file for the SkySQL Cloud Data Suite API
	[database]
	; path should become obsolete when all DB access is via the API
	path = "/usr/local/skysql/SQLite/AdminConsole/admin"
	pdoconnect = "sqlite:/usr/local/skysql/SQLite/AdminConsole/admin"
	user = ""
	password = ""
	[logging]
	directory = "/usr/local/skysql/log"
	errorlog = yes
	erroremail = "mark.riddoch@skysql.com"
	[shell]
	path = "shell/"
	[monitor-defaults]
	interval = 1800
	count = 15
	[apikeys]
	1 = "1f8d9e040e65d7b105538b1ed0231770"


6. Ensure the timezone is set correctly in the php.ini file

7. Start the httpd for the RESTful API

8. Add a system into the system table of the sqlite schema

	insert into System (SystemId, SystemName, State) values
		(1, 'My Test System', 0);

9. Add nodes into the node table of the sqlite schema

	insert into Node (NodeID, SystemID, NameName, State, Hostname,
		PublicIP, PrivateIP, Username, passwd) values 
			(1, 1, 'Node 1', 0, 'hostname', 'xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx',
				'xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx', 'username', 'password');

	PublicIP and PrivateIP may be the same and shoudl be the
	IP address of the mysql instance you wish to monitor

	hostname is just the hostname of the machine on which it runs

	username and password and the MySQL username and password
	that the monitor uses to log into the MySQL database

10. Start the monitor application, passing the API key and API keyid
that you set in api.ini as Java Properties

	java -DSKYSQL_APIKEYID=1 -DSKYSQL_APIKEY=1f8d9e040e65d7b105538b1ed0231770 -classpath ClusterMonitor.jar com.skysql.monitor.ClusterMonitor -v 1 /usr/local/skysql/SQLite/AdminConsole/admin

11. Check the logfile /var/log/SkySQL-ClusterMonitor.log for messages
on each insert of data or other activitiy
